At some point in the not to distant future, there will be availability of _mega_ scale electrical power, via highly scaled hot fusion reactors, and/or possibly highly scaled newer-generation fission reactors. At that point, pulling water out of the ocean at scale will be viable. Pump it out by the cubic kilometer, reverse-osmosis distill it, and then pump it into the Sahara desert for example. The Sahara could be turned into a golf course or an architected megapolis of skyscraper gardens. The place is the size of the continental U.S., to give you an idea of the significance of that. Also the Gobi, the entirety of Australia. So the habitable area of the planet will be doubled or tripled. You might well ask what would happen to sea levels with all this water being pumped out of the ocean, not to mention weather patterns with all the terraforming going on. Consider Antarctica: all of its ice is above sea level; remember also we have access now to effectively unlimited mega scale electricity. So, of course, we melt all the ice on Antarctica just like you would with the iron filament in a hair dryer. Voila, yet another previously uninhabited continent available for human activity. The future could be an interesting and wonderful place, if we get past the clusterfuq of a present. Of course, there are dangers to meddling, and maybe nothing should be done beyond some reforestation. I suggest more funding for supercomputer climate simulations.
